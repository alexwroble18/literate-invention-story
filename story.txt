Once upon a time a stressed and depressed student tried to do his homework.
Although this student tried his best, but the homework was so hard for this 
student to finish.
Being very stressed and very depressed, he took a gap year in order to help foster a positive mental state. 
While on his gap year, he started his own business and became a millionaire and realized that $50,000 a year for college wasn't worth it even though society tells us we must go into financial ruin for an education while people get rich off of us even though we're just trying to be successful. He later ran for president and won by a large margin. The end.
